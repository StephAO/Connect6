# Connect6

This is a connect6 program which will allow you to play against a computer, or watch a computer play itself.
I have never been able to beat it (I have managed to draw it before though).

To compile use: gcc -o <executable file name> main.c
To run on windows: ...> <executable file name>
To run on Linux: % ./<executable file name>

Board is always a square
Recommended board size: 19

Note: board sizes under 6 will run fine, but will always result in a draw

To play against the computer, input 'h' when asked
To watch the computer play itself, input 'c' when asked

Have fun!
